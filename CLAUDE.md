"Turn a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best."

This is the converted project description for Fedora usage. All Ubuntu/Debian-specific commands have been converted to their Fedora dnf equivalents.
